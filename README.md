# Whack-a-Mole Game 🎯

## Game Description
This is a simple **Whack-a-Mole** browser game where players click (or tap) on moles that pop up randomly in a 3×3 grid. Each successful hit increases your score.  
You win if you reach the target score before the timer runs out!

- **Win condition:** Reach 20 points before time = 0  
- **Lose condition:** Timer hits 0 with score below 20  
- **Controls:** Click or tap on the holes to “whack” the mole

The game uses timed loops (`setInterval` and `setTimeout`) to manage mole spawns, visibility, and countdowns. The difficulty increases automatically as your score rises.

## New Feature Added ⭐
I implemented **dynamic difficulty scaling** — every 5 points, moles appear faster and disappear quicker.  
This adds excitement and makes the game progressively harder.
